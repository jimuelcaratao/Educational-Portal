The event includes Mr. and Ms. Executives, spoken poetry, singing contest, dance contest, mobile legend tournament, poster and slogan making, and chess competition. This event also allows students to compete in major BSOAD subjects such as stenography dictation and quiz bee, speed typing, office procedures quiz bee, accounting quiz bee, computer quiz bee, and web design making contest.</p>

            <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                Each section has a representative for each contest making this event more of a teamwork rather than an individual competition. Students who did not join the competition still show support for their classmates, and make a conscious effort to win their candidate.
